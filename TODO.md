# Itinerary Builder Summary View Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated EventCard component to pass isDetailedView prop to event subcomponents
- [x] Modified FlightEvent to show only "fromCity ⟶ toCity" in summary view
- [x] Modified HotelEvent to show only hotel name in summary view
- [x] Modified ActivityEvent to show only activity name in summary view
- [x] Modified TransferEvent to show only "fromLocation → toLocation" in summary view
- [x] Verified ImageEvent already handles isDetailedView correctly

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the summary and detailed view toggle functionality
- [ ] Verify that detailed view remains unchanged
- [ ] Check for any TypeScript errors or runtime issues
- [ ] Ensure proper styling and layout in both views

## Summary View Behavior
- **Flight**: Shows "fromCity ⟶ toCity" with plane icon
- **Hotel**: Shows hotel name with hotel icon
- **Activity**: Shows activity name with camera icon
- **Transfer**: Shows "fromLocation → toLocation" with car icon
- **Image**: Shows image with title (already implemented)
- **Other components**: Use existing summary rendering in EventCard
